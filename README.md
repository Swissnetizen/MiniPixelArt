#MiniPixelArt

A place to store my 16Ã—16 pixel art. Licensed under CC-BY 4.0.

## How to open
You open the rasterised versions in the [PNGs](PNGs) folder. These may not reflect the Pixen versions as I may have forgotten to update them.

You will need [Pixen](http://pixenapp.com/) to open the _.pix_ files(layered). I recommend buying it on the Mac App Store, however,
you may also download the source from [github](https://github.com/Pixen/Pixen) and compile it manually.
